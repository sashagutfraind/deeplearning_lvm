Large vector models - a transformer architecture for mixed token-text models

## Abstract
Large vector model (LVM) is a generalization of the LLM class of models used in language generation in generative AI.
LVMs are transformer-based models designed for prediction of temporal sequences with tokens.
However, unlike LLMs that generate human-language tokens, LVM can generate a sequence of $R^n$ vectors
or a mixture of aligned tokens-vectors.
LVM model promise to help in prediction of time series data in a variety of significant applications.
In particular, it provides an important generalization of binary classification problems involving extended patient history.
